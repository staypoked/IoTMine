zephyr.dts file is the devicetree: Alias definition and so on; soc part where all the devices are listed

hint: search in the device tree like for 'leds' and access the devices (led0, led1, led2)

device tree with bindings are compiled into devicetree_unfixed.h collectis all properties for each device

find the bindings /home/osboxes/Documeâ€¦/zephyr/dts/bindings/gpio



The RTT J-Link Viewer is needed to see the output of the rtt example from the thingy52_nrf52832


Use DT_PATH() to specify the hierarchy of the yaml file you are using

Find additional information regarding the sensors in the driver: For all sensors first fetch and then sample otherwise you will not get new values.
